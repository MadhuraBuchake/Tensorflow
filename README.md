# Tensorflow

I have performed Regression on California Housing Data set using Tensorflow. The dataset contains information about all the block groups in California from 1990. In this sample a block of group on an average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically compact area. I have approximated the median house value of each from the values of the rest of the variables.

The Original Data set can be found out at

The Features are:

housingMedianAge: continuous. 
totalRooms: continuous. 
totalBedrooms: continuous. 
population: continuous. 
households: continuous. 
medianIncome: continuous. 
medianHouseValue: continuous.
